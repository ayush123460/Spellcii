## About the Game

The objective of this game is to eat the letters in such an order that it forms a real word! There are 10 levels of difficulty, ranging from 3 letter words to 10 letter words! Definitely not easy once you go above level 7. ;)

## Why a console game?

The game looks very polished even for a console game, with fancy menu selectors and a very nice looking startup screen! This project is from 2017, solely made for the purpose of showing how great console graphics can be made to be with minimal logic. This is written in C++/11, and uses the Win32 API for all of the keyboard input (conio.h) and console drawing functionality! There is also an inbuilt dictionary for the near 500k words this has!

Enough about the features, this was made for an inter-school "technology" show, and I felt like this was the best I could provide given that I loved nothing other than C++ at that time. On a completely different note, this game is restricted to 80x25 as that was the very first display mode on most home computer systems in the 1980s!

## What's missing?

This game lacks a couple of features that I didn't implement -

- A timer for finishing the level (decreases with increasing difficulty)
- Monsters that would eat you
	- To complement this, a "life" system
- Proper sprites (this only uses ASCII characters)

However, I don't think I would like to implement these as these are just quality of life features. The English department of my school did have a fun time playing this "as-is"!
